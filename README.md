Book Share
Version 1.0.0

Project Description
-------------------
Book Share is a web application that lists all books that are currently available for rent for all RPI students and faculty to address
the ongoing issue of having to pay for expensive textbooks/reading materials that are required for academia. This application is modeled
after the popular "ride sharing" programs in that students/faculty are able to send out a query for a requested book and those who
have it available will be able to share it with the user. Upon first use of the application, the user must create an account in which
he/she will then be able to search for books, put his/her own books up for availability, and track book borrowing history.
